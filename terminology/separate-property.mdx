Property that is to remain yours, and yours alone, and not be considered part of the marital estate. Gifts can also be separate property (even if you didn’t use your own money to purchase it), so long as you specify that they should be considered Separate Property in the prenuptial agreement. In some states, Separate Property is also called “Nonmarital Property.”
