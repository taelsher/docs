Alimony, also known as spousal support, is a legal obligation for one spouse to provide financial support to the other spouse after a divorce or legal separation. It is intended to help the receiving spouse maintain the same standard of living that they had during the marriage.

The purpose of alimony is to provide financial assistance to the dependent spouse, ensuring that they have sufficient resources to meet their basic needs and maintain their standard of living after the divorce. Alimony can be either temporary, which is paid during the process of the divorce, or permanent, which is paid until a specific event occurs, such as the remarriage of the receiving spouse, social security retirement age, or the death of either party.

The amount and duration of alimony is determined by state law or guidelines, considering several factors such as the length of the marriage, the earning capacity of each party, the contributions of each party to the marriage, and the needs of each party. The court will also consider the financial needs of each party, including the ability to support themselves after the divorce, and whether one party is at a disadvantage due to the divorce.
