## Separate Property

Under this prenuptial agreement, "Separate Property," also referred to as "Non-Marital Property" or "Separate Estate," encompasses various types of assets owned by one party prior to the marriage or acquired under specific conditions. The key aspects of Separate Property include:

- **Assets List**: Any assets detailed in attached Exhibits "A" and "B" are considered Separate Property.

- **Acquisition Types**:

  - Properties received as gifts, legacies, or through descent.
  - Properties acquired in exchange for assets owned before the marriage or received as gifts, legacies, or descent.
  - Properties explicitly excluded by a valid agreement between the parties.
  - Properties owned before marriage.
  - Accounts or properties acquired post-marriage in one party's name, without using marital funds.
  - Appreciation and income from the aforementioned assets, under certain conditions.

- **Retirement Plans**: Benefits and accounts accrued before marriage in retirement plans remain Separate Property, subject to specific documentation and agreement compliance.

- **Income and Property Acquisitions**: Income or property acquired by a party's effort, either before or after marriage, which is not commingled with the other party's assets, is deemed Separate Property.

## Marital Property

Marital Property refers to assets acquired during the marriage and includes:

- **Jointly Titled Assets**: Property acquired during the marriage, titled in both parties' names.

- **Contributions and Transfers**: Utilization of income or Separate Property to jointly acquire or title property. Appreciation of such jointly held assets is also considered Marital Property.

- **Division upon Separation**: In legal separations or marriage dissolutions, Marital Property is typically divided equally between the parties.

### Contributions and Transmutations

- **Non-Transmutation of Separate Property**: Contributions to Separate Property from Marital funds are considered gifts unless specified otherwise through legal documentation or objection.

- **Protection of Separate Property**: Any post-separation contributions to Separate Property are subject to reimbursement to the Marital Estate, ensuring the Separate Property's integrity.

## Legal Advisories

- **Income Post-Marriage**: Income earned after marriage is presumed to be Marital unless stipulated otherwise in the agreement.

- **Retirement Contributions**: Post-marriage contributions to retirement accounts are treated as Separate Property if not commingled.
