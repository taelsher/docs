## 1. No Refund Policy

Because NikahPrenup users have ample opportunity to review and request information from the team, we do not offer refunds after you have paid.

## 2. Nikah Prenup is Not a Law Firm and Does Not Provide Legal Advice

NikahPrenup provides a platform for general information on prenuptial agreements and self-help. The information provided by NikahPrenup along with the content on our website related to legal matters (“Legal Information”) is provided for your private use and does not constitute legal advice. NikahPrenup does not offer legal advice or representation and is not a law firm or a substitute for the advice or services of an attorney or law firm. We do not review any information you provide us for legal accuracy or sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, provide opinions about your selection of forms, or apply the law to the facts of your situation.
We strive to keep our content accurate, current and up-to date. However, because the law changes rapidly, we cannot guarantee that all of the information on the site is completely current. The law is different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and may be subject to interpretation by different courts. The law is a personal matter, and no general information or legal tools like the kind we provide can fit every circumstance.
If you need legal advice for a specific problem, you should consult with a licensed attorney. Neither NikahPrenup nor any Legal Information provided by Nikah Prenup is a substitute for legal advice from a qualified attorney licensed to practice in an appropriate jurisdiction. As NikahPrenup is not a law firm, please note that communications between you and NikahPrenup are not protected as privileged communications under the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine.
Your use of the Services does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and NikahPrenup.
NikahPrenup is not a “Lawyer Referral Service”. NikahPrenup does not endorse or recommend any attorney nor does it make any warranty as to the qualifications or competency of any attorney.
